# Dnd-char-tracker
Did you ever struggle with your d&d notes trying to track your character's sources? Forgot to tick that you already used your action surge and ended up having more turns than you should in the boss battle? Struggle no more!
Dnd-char-tracker is here to help you configure and keep track of your character resources such as Feat / Skill charges, spell slots, health, xp and even currency tracking!!
